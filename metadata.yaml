description: '"Growing up a hard life as an orphan, Nancy Olden falls into the wrong
  crowd and a life of crime. She''s quick on her feet and quick with her tongue, talking
  herself out of trouble most of the time. Through a series of misadventures (she''s
  not THAT successful a con artist, really), she begins to rely on the kindness of
  strangers and slowly straightens her life out. She has only one last scam to play
  in order to help those who have helped her. Will Nancy be able to save the day?
  Or will this be the job to finally send her up the river to the big house?"--Amazon.'
